In today’s digital world, secure passwords are essential to protect sensitive data. Weak passwords (like
only numbers or only alphabets) are highly vulnerable to cyberattacks. A password checker is required
to verify the strength of a password based on its composition.
The program should read a password from the user and analyze its characters using a for loop. It must
count uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. Based on these counts, the
program will determine if the password is Weak, Moderate, or Strong.
Objectives:
• To use a for loop to traverse each character of the password string.
• To check and classify characters into:
• Uppercase letters (A–Z)
• Lowercase letters (a–z)
• Digits (0–9)
• Special characters (@, #, $, %, !, etc.)
• To decide password strength based on composition rules.
• To demonstrate practical use of loops in real-world cybersecurity applications.
Password Strength Rules:
➢ Weak:
• Length < 6 OR contains only one type of character (e.g., only digits).
➢ Moderate:
• Length ≥ 6 AND contains at least two types of characters (e.g., letters + digits).
➢ Strong:
• Length ≥ 8 AND contains all four types (uppercase, lowercase, digits, special).
Expected Outcome:
➢ Program should count and display character categories.
➢ Based on rules, display the password’s strength.
➢ Should handle different test cases (weak, moderate, strong).
